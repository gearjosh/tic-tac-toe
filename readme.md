# _Ultra Tic Tac Toe_

#### _A JavaScript Game of Tic Tac Toe  8/15/2018_

#### By _**Dan Mace & Josh Gearheart**_

## Description

_This site was created to explore logic statements through constructors and prototypes.  It's a game of Tic Tac Toe.  The app switches turns with users placing an X or an O on the board.  The app drops an alert when you try to place an X or O on an already claimed square.  The winning player is displayed upon winning._

## Project Specifications

* _Later.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _ES6 compatible browser required to view_
* _Must have local versions of Materialize, jQuery and Google Font families to run offline_


## Known Bugs // Future Updates

_Add tiebreaker scenario_

_Add reset board button_

_Add Player Name inputs to display on win_
_Hide game board until submit on Player Name inputs, and hide inputs on submit_

_Figure out a true center on columns with materialize or bootstrap? Not possible...?_
_Because columns are floated in order to make the divs display next to each other.  Not using Materialize/Bootstrap container/row/columns and constructing this from scratch using strict positioning would improve UI balance.  Center can be feigned in M/BS with even columns using offsets with offset-s4 or similar._

_Add Game Mode Option at Input Screen: Play 1D Tic-Tac-Toe (just set all gamesquares to one row)_
